##Branch policy & general usage tips

-It is greatly suggested that you pull from master every time before you make changes.

-When ready to push, push to your own branch by either creating the branch on the repo directly or using:

  _'git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch-name>'_

-Once you have pushed, navigate to the repo and create a pull request for your branch with master as the base.

#IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER.
